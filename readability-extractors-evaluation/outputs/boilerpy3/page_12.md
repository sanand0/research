Optimizing for quality of user experience is key to the long-term success of any site on the web. Whether you're a business owner, marketer, or developer, Web Vitals can help you quantify the experience of your site and identify opportunities to improve.
Overview
Web Vitals is an initiative by Google to provide unified guidance for quality signals that are essential to delivering a great user experience on the web.
Google has provided a number of tools over the years to measure and report on performance. Some developers are experts at using these tools, while others have found the abundance of both tools and metrics challenging to keep up with.
Site owners shouldn't have to be performance experts to understand the quality of experience they are delivering to their users. The Web Vitals initiative aims to simplify the landscape, and help sites focus on the metrics that matter most, the Core Web Vitals.
Core Web Vitals
Core Web Vitals are the subset of Web Vitals that apply to all web pages, should be measured by all site owners, and will be surfaced across all Google tools. Each of the Core Web Vitals represents a distinct facet of the user experience, is measurable in the field , and reflects the real-world experience of a critical user-centric outcome.
The metrics that make up Core Web Vitals will evolve over time. The current set focuses on three aspects of the user experience—loading, interactivity, and visual stability—and includes the following metrics (and their respective thresholds):
Largest Contentful Paint (LCP) : measures loading performance. To provide a good user experience, LCP should occur within 2.5 seconds of when the page first starts loading.
Interaction to Next Paint (INP) : measures interactivity. To provide a good user experience, pages should have a INP of 200 milliseconds or less.
Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS) : measures visual stability. To provide a good user experience, pages should maintain a CLS of 0.1. or less.
To ensure you're hitting the recommended target for these metrics for most of your users, a good threshold to measure is the 75th percentile of page loads, segmented across mobile and desktop devices.
Tools that assess Core Web Vitals compliance should consider a page passing if it meets the recommended targets at the 75th percentile for all three of the Core Web Vitals metrics.

Lifecycle
Metrics on the Core Web Vitals track go through a lifecycle consisting of three phases: experimental, pending, and stable.
The stages of the Core Web Vitals lifecycle.
Each phase is designed to signal to developers how they should think about each metric:
Experimental metrics are prospective Core Web Vitals that may still be undergoing significant changes depending on testing and community feedback.
Pending metrics are future Core Web Vitals that have passed the testing and feedback stage and have a well-defined timeline to becoming stable.
Stable metrics are the current set of Core Web Vitals that Chrome considers essential for great user experiences.
The Core Web Vitals are at the following lifecycle stages:
