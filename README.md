# Research

- 10 Nov 2025: [`codex-fastapi-streaming`](codex-fastapi-streaming/). FastAPI + SSE wrapper lets you stream Codex CLI in a browser.
- 10 Nov 2025: [`pyodide-pandas-breakeven`](pyodide-pandas-breakeven/). Use native JS instead of Pyodide + Pandas—the 30s load penalty means the browser never reaches a performance break-even.
- 10 Nov 2025: [`uv-cache-mount-benchmark`](uv-cache-mount-benchmark/). BuildKit cache mounts cut `uv pip install` from 11.7s to 1.7s, so ship cache mounts (or bind mounts) for any repeatable Docker build.
- 10 Nov 2025: [`gh-auth-dev-containers`](gh-auth-dev-containers/). Use the `GH_TOKEN` env var (with optional hosts.yml mount) to share GitHub CLI auth across dev containers despite keyring limitations.
- 11 Nov 2025: [`json-tools-benchmark`](json-tools-benchmark/). jaq is ~40% faster than jq, while native Node excels at heavy transforms and nearly every tool now streams results.
- 11 Nov 2025: [`dom-markdown-extractor-eval`](dom-markdown-extractor-eval/). Use `node-html-markdown` for HTML to Markdown. Has 97% accuracy. `markdownify` is a readability-focused backup, and turndown still can’t handle tables.
